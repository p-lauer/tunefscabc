# Adjusting Optimization Algorithms For Estimating Material Parameters In Fire Simulation

Necesseray files to reproduce the analysis presented on the poster "Adjusting Optimization Algorithms For Estimating Material Parameters In Fire Simulation" at the 12th International Symposium on Fire Safety Science, June 2017, Lund University, Sweden.

## Requirements

- Python with SpotPy (https://github.com/thouska/spotpy)
- Perl
- Fire Dynamics Simulator 6 (https://github.com/firemodels/fds)
- Lots of time (single run needs approx. 20 h on 1400 cores)

## Getting started

- Put your FDS binary in fast/sims/template/sims/ and mc/sims/template/sims/ 
- Start fast/start_sens_fast.py and mc/start_sens_fast.py
